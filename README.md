# MCP Authorization Secured API

How organizations can expose APIs using the draft [Model Content Protocol Authorization](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26/basic/authorization) specification.\
The code example shows how to use an MCP server to expose existing OAuth-secured APIs to AI agents.

## Overview

The end-to-end flow starts when an example MCP client calls a stateless MCP server.

![MCP Flow](images/mcp-flow.png)

The MCP client securely connects to the MCP server with an opaque access token.\
A [phantom token plugin](https://github.com/curityio/nginx-lua-phantom-token-plugin) uses OAuth introspection to translate the opaque access token to a JWT access token.\
APIs use a JWT access token to implement their authorization.

## Backend Endpoints

All external URLs are exposed using an instance of the Kong API gateway.\
The backend includes a utility MCP server that acts as an extension to the API gateway.\
MCP clients connect to the MCP server using a Streamable HTTP transport.

| Endpoint | URL |
| -------- | --- |
| MCP Server Entry Point | http://mcp.demo.example |
| Stocks API | http://api.demo.example/stocks |
| Stocks API Resource Server Metadata | http://api.demo.example/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource/stocks |
| Curity Identity Server OAuth Metadata | http://login.demo.example/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server |
| Curity Identity Server Admin UI | http://admin.demo.example/admin |
| Test Email Inbox | http://mail.demo.example |

To enable the use of these domains on your local computer, add the following entries to the `/etc/hosts` file.

```text
127.0.0.1 api.demo.example mcp.demo.example admin.demo.example login.demo.example mail.demo.example
```

The Curity Identity Server implements OAuth standards to enable the authorization from the specification.\
You can log into the Admin UI with a username and password of `admin / Password1`.

## Run the End-to-End Flow

Typically you do not control the client or its code, and MCP clients make standards-based connections.\
The deployed backend uses standards-based security to enable many MCP clients to connect.

### Install Prerequisites

First, install Docker and Node.js on your local computer.\
Get a [Trial License](https://developer.curity.io/free-trial) for the Curity Identity Server from the Curity developer portal.\
Save the license to your desktop as a `license.json` file.

### Deploy the Backend

Run the following commands to deploy all backend components and provide OAuth-secured endpoints.

```bash
export LICENSE_FILE_PATH=~/Desktop/license.json
./build.sh
./deploy.sh
```

### Run the MCP Client

Run any MCP client that implements the behavior from the MCP draft authorization specification.\
You can use this repo's [Example MCP Client](mcp-client/README.md), which runs as a console application.\
Use the following commands to run the client.

```bash
cd mcp-client
npm install
npm start
```

The MCP client integrates with the MCP server to run OAuth flows and make a secured connection.\
The user can then run MCP tools to invoke API requests and access authorized resources.\
The example API returns some hard-coded fictional stock prices.

```

### MCP Client Flow

The MCP client uses the following steps to get an access token and call the API:

- Resource server metadata download.
- Authorization server metadata download.
- Dynamic client registration.
- User authentication.
- User consent.

Only MCP clients operated by the following administrator approved users can gain access to secured API data.\
These users must prove ownership of their corporate email to authenticate themselves.\
You can simulate that by entering one of the emails and typing a one-time password from the test email inbox.

- `john.doe@demo.example`
- `jane.test@demo.example`

![user-authentication](images/user-authentication.png)

Users must then consent to granting the MCP client access to API data.\
The user is informed about the level of data access the AI agent requests.

![user-consent](images/user-consent.png)

### Secure Access Tokens

The MCP client then receives the following form of token response:

```json
{
  "access_token": "_0XBPWQQ_d8ed4b47-7d85-455f-8d7e-03b08e84428b",
  "token_type": "bearer",
  "expires_in": 900,
  "scope": "stocks/read",
}
```

Notice the following access token characteristics returned to MCP clients (and therefore AI agents).\
These measures help to mitigate risks of releasing access tokens to AI agents:

- The MCP client is unable to read any access token claims.
- The MCP client's access token is short-lived with a limited scope.
- The MCP client does not receive a refresh token.

The [Kong API gateway routes](apigateway/kong.yml) expose both the MCP server and API endpoints.\
The MCP server receives a scoped JWT access token with a payload similar to the following.\
The MCP server forwards this JWT access token to upstream APIs.

```json
{
  "jti": "2dc6cc38-d77f-4378-ba80-ba9d945141ff",
  "delegationId": "cd0c96fd-5fc3-4a92-a9fc-caf40e4e9b0c",
  "exp": 1749650409,
  "nbf": 1749650109,
  "scope": "stocks/read",
  "iss": "http://login.demo.example/oauth/v2/oauth-anonymous",
  "sub": "john.doe@demo.example",
  "aud": "8e636b87-6b22-4ca0-a602-a8ecacec1b84",
  "iat": 1749650109,
  "purpose": "access_token"
}
```

The Curity Identity Server can also issue any custom claims to the access token.\
APIs must then authorize, to protect data using [scopes](https://curity.io/resources/learn/scope-best-practices/) and [claims](https://curity.io/resources/learn/claims-best-practices/).
